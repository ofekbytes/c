- level 1: C

-- C is a low-level language that relates closely to the way machines work while still being easy to learn. 

-!- Understanding how computer memory works is an important aspect of the C programming language

--- example:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() 
    {
        printf("Welcome !\n");

        return 0;
    }


--- example information

    #include <stdio.h>
    The function "printf()" used for generating output is defined in "stdio.h" (header file).

    int main() 
    The main() function is the entry point to a program. 

    { } 
    Curly brackets indicate the beginning and end of a function (code block). 

    \n 
    escape sequence - new line;

    return 0;
    returns the value 0 to the calling process.
    0 generally means that our program has successfully executed.
    Any other number indicates that the program has failed.

--- example: 
    <c-1.1.c>: c first program

- level 1.1 - C - Data Types
,

- C data types: 

-- int: integer (12).
-- float: floating point (1.23).
-- double: double-precision floating point value (1.23).
-- char: single character ('c').

--- example: variable:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() 
    {
        printf("int: %d \n", sizeof(int));
        printf("float: %d \n", sizeof(float));
        printf("double: %d \n", sizeof(double));
        printf("char: %d \n", sizeof(char));

        return 0;
    }
